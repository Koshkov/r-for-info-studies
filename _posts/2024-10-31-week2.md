title: "Week 2: Cleaning and Visualizing Movie Data"
---

# Introduction

This week's data from Tidy Tuesday is about monster movies! It can be accessed 
[here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2024/2024-10-29/readme.md).
We will use this data to look at how movie ratings have changed over the years.

The purpose of this exercise is to get familiar with `ggplot2` and `plotly`. These
are both powerful libraries that allow you to create professional and 
sophisticated plots, charts, and graphs.

# R Code

If you haven't installed R or R Studio, make sure to visit the 
[quick start]({{ site.baseurl }}/quickstart.html).

You can view the entire R script on GitHub [here](https://github.com/Koshkov/r-for-info-studies/blob/main/activites/week3.R).

## Setup 

The first thing we have to do is load into `tidyverse` our environment and 
pull the dataset from Tidy Tuesday. We will also be loading in `plotly` which
allows us to build interactive charts!

```
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)

tuesdata<-tidytuesdayR::tt_load("2024-10-29") 

```
This week's data set is split into two data frames called `monster_movies` and
`monster_movie_genres`. We will pull each of these in and assign them to their 
own variable. This will make them easier to access later in the code.  
```
movies.df <- tuesdata$monster_movies
genres.df <- tuesdata$monster_movie_genres

rm(tuesdata) # We can get rid of this now - I no longer need it
```

Before we do anything, it's always good to look at the data. Again, we can
use the `View` function to open the data frames in a new tab in RStudio to
take a closer look at the data. 
```
View(movies.df)
View(genres.df)
```
We can also pass the data frames through the summary function to tell us 
how many rows we have, the minimum values, maximum values, and a lot of
other useful information.

```
summary(movies.df)
summary(genres.df)
```

## Data Cleaning 

Now that we have a good sense of what our data looks like, we can start cleaning
it up. Let's start by combining the movies with their genres. Notice that
each data frame contains a field called `tconst`. This column contains unique 
identifiers for each movie title (kind of like a primary key). We can use 
the `left_join` function to combine both table into one table we will name
`combined.df`.

```
combined.df <- movies.df %>% 
  select(-genres) %>% # remove the "genres" column so that I don't have a duplicate
  left_join( # this function combines the two data sets 
    genres.df,
    by="tconst" # match on this column
  )
```

Next, we want to take an average rating of every genre and aggregate them in a
table. We will use this table to make a plot.
```
rating.by.genre<-combined.df  %>%
    group_by(genres) %>%       
    filter(!is.na(genres)) %>% # Remove all missing genres
    summarise(
        genre_rating=mean(average_rating) # take the average of every genre
    )
```

## Plotting

Now that we've combined and summarised our data, let's make a simple chart! 
To do this, we will use the `ggplot2` library that comes packaged with 
`tidyverse`.

```
rating.by.genre %>% ggplot(
        aes(y=fct_reorder(genres,genre_rating), x=genre_rating),
    )+
    geom_col(fill="orange")+
    theme_minimal() +
    # Set labels for the graph
    labs(title="Average Ratings of Movie Genres for Movies involving Monsters",
         subtitle="Spooky Graph",
         x="Ratings",
         y="Genres",
    )

```

This will result in the following chart.
