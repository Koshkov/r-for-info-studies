# R 101

R is a programming language designed to perform statistics, data visualization,
and machine learning. R was created in 1993. It is an open source project and 
is free to download and use without any restrictions. 

R is used in many different fields including:

* Data science
* Information science  
* Bioinformatics
* Business analytics
* and more!

## RStudio 

RStudio is a sophisticated code editor for the R programming language. View
the [quick start]({{ site.baseurl }}/quickstart.html) guide to learn how to 
install R and RStudio.

By default, RStudio has a four panel layout as depicted below.

## Basic Syntax

R has a simple and easy to learn syntax. It was designed to be accessible to 
non-programmers and researchers. First we will start with some basic math
functions.

```
# Anything that begins with a hashtag is a comment
# This allows you to add notes to your program 

1 + 1    # Addition
2 - 1    # Subtraction
5 * 1    # Multipliation
25 / 5   # Division
5^2      # Exponents
```

If you want to save the output of an operation for later use, you can store
it in a variable. The assignment operator in R is `<-`. 

## Installing and Loading Packages

Over the years, the R community has created many additional features.  These 
features are bundled together in packages. Packages can be installed easily 
using the `install.packages` function. 

Suppose we wanted to install `ggplot2` (a package that allows you to build 
nice looking graphs). In the R console, type out the following command 
and press enter.

```
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

This will download the package from the internet and install the it on your 
computer. Then, whenever you want to use it in an R script, you can you can load 
it into your environment using the `library` function. Suppose we wanted to load
`ggplot2`. We could write the following command.

```
library(ggplot2)
```
